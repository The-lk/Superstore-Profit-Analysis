 Superstore-Profit-Analysis
A Power BI project focused on identifying profit leaks and discount strategies.

📊 Project Overview
This analysis evaluates a Superstore’s performance across 48 states. While total revenue reached $2.3M, the goal was to identify why certain regions and products were losing money despite high sales volume.

🚀 Key Business Insights
The Profit Engine: The Technology category is the most efficient, contributing 50.8% of total profits from only 36% of sales.

The Discount Trap: Analysis reveals a sharp decline in profitability when discounts exceed 20%. Capping discounts at 15% is the primary recommendation for recovery.

Critical Losses: The Tables sub-category is the most significant concern, operating at a net loss of $17,725 due to high shipping costs and aggressive pricing.

Geographic Focus: While California and New York are revenue anchors, states like Texas and Ohio are currently "loss-leaders" requiring urgent strategy shifts.

🛠️ Tools & Skills
Power BI: Data modeling and interactive dashboard design.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Created measures for Profit Margin %, Total Sales, and Year-over-Year growth.

Data Visualization: Applied professional formatting (Muted color palettes, Grid layouts, and Conditional Formatting) to improve decision-making.

💡 Recommendations
Restrict Discounts: Implement a hard cap of 15% on Furniture discounts to move the category back into profitability.

Product Mix: Increase inventory and marketing spend for Technology and Office Supplies (Paper/Envelopes) which show the highest ROI
Logistics: Audit shipping routes in the Central Region to reduce overhead on heavy furniture items.
